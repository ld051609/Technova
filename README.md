# Welcome to our SafeTrip App ðŸ‘‹

**SafeTrip** was inspired by the need for safer KW experiences. As KW becomes busier and more populated, concerns about personal safety, especially in high-crime areas, have risen significantly. We wanted to create a solution that empowers users to make informed decisions about their routes and destinations by providing real-time crime data.
